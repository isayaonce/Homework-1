            <h1> The Song of Hiawatha </h1>
<p>
"In the vale of Tawasentha,<br>
In the green and silent valley,<br>
By the pleasant water-courses,<br>
Dwelt the singer Nawadaha.<br>
Round about the Indian village<br>
Spread the meadows and the corn-fields,<br>
And beyond them stood the forest,<br>
Stood the groves of singing pine-trees,<br>
Green in Summer, white in Winter,<br>
Ever sighing, ever singing.<br>
  "And the pleasant water-courses,<br>
You could trace them through the valley,<br>
By the rushing in the Spring-time,<br>
By the alders in the Summer,<br>
By the white fog in the Autumn,<br>
By the black line in the Winter;<br>
And beside them dwelt the singer,<br>
In the vale of Tawasentha,<br>
In the green and silent valley.<br>
  "There he sang of Hiawatha,<br>
Sang the Song of Hiawatha,<br>
Sang his wondrous birth and being,<br>
How he prayed and how be fasted,<br>
How he lived, and toiled, and suffered,<br>
That the tribes of men might prosper,<br>
That he might advance his people!"<br>
  Ye who love the haunts of Nature,<br>
Love the sunshine of the meadow,<br>
Love the shadow of the forest,<br>
Love the wind among the branches,<br>
And the rain-shower and the snow-storm,<br>
And the rushing of great rivers<br>
Through their palisades of pine-trees,<br>
And the thunder in the mountains,<br>
Whose innumerable echoes<br>
Flap like eagles in their eyries;--<br>
Listen to these wild traditions,<br>
To this Song of Hiawatha!<br>
<br>
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
